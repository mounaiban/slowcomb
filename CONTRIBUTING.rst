Contributing to Slowcomb on GitHub for EXPERTS
----------------------------------------------
Wow! I'd never expect someone to be actually interested in contributing to,
let alone using the Slow Combinatorics Library, but here you are.

Slowcomb was intended to be some kind of personal learning journal in Python
programming (and a bit of a high school maths refresher), but if you are going
to be a force in taking this project beyond what it is right now, let me thank
you in advance for your interest in my little project, whatever the motivation,
as long as it is for the good of humankind.

Contributing to Slowcomb should not be too different from how it's done
with some of the major projects on GitHub, perhaps with only one real
difference: I am the sole authority on what gets pulled into master.ðŸ˜ˆ

If you are a fairly seasoned developer who uses GitHub a lot, or has had
reasonable experience with other communities (e.g. GitLab, SourceForge),
you are likely familiar with the contribution process endorsed here already.
I hope you have a good time messing around, and may your contributions
become something to be proud of!

Cheers,

\- Moses

Executive Summary
-----------------
The process endorsed on this project is basically like:

1. Optionally, learn how to use Git and Virtual Environments (VE).
   You might have chosen to go with GitHub Desktop, or an IDE that
   handles VEs and packaging in one spot.

2. Optionally, set up a VE on your file system

3. Fork Slowcomb, thus creating your personal branch of the Slowcomb
   master branch.

4. Clone Slowcomb to your file system.

5. If using a VE, activate it.
  
6. Hack: play around as necessary, add your modifications, enhancements
   or bugfixes

7. Write and run Tests

8. If satisfied, commit your changes to your local Git repository,
   then push those changes to your branch on GitHub.

9. If interrupted by the need to make an urgent change which may
   affect an incomplete change, stash your work in progress. Then,
   pop your WIP back when you are done with the urgent edit.

10. When you feel ready, make a pull request to the master branch at
    https://github.com/mounaiban/slowcomb.

11. Pull *from* master to keep your other files up-to-date

12. Goto Step 4
