class CustomBaseNumberF(object):
    """
    Number with a custom base, with radix determined by a function.
    The radix may be either uniform or non-uniform.

    Numbers handled by this class are of a fixed length, and digits are
    handled as individual integers in a list. Currently, only positive
    integers are supported.

    Required Arguments
    ------------------
    * length - the length of the number. Accepts int, where length >= 0.
    
    * func_radix - function to determine the radix of a digit. Lambdas
      and methods are accepted. The definition should be like:
    
      ::

      func(i)

      Where i is the position of the digit, 0 < i < length, and i == 0
      determines the radix of the leftmost or most significant digit.

    Optional Arguments
    ------------------
    * digits - the digits of the number, if the number is to have an
      initial state.
    
    Exceptions
    ----------
    * TypeError is raised when an attempt is made to specify the length
      using a non-integer.

    * ValueError is raised when a negative integer is specified as the
      length of the number.
      

    Notes
    -----
    This class is being investigated for performance issues. Preliminary
    tests with the CPython interpreter suggest that calls to
    func_radix() to determine the radix of a digit incur a significant
    performance penalty. For the time being, the use of this class is only
    recommended for problems where it is unreasonable to specify the radices
    of the digits ahead of time.

class PBTreeCombinatorialUnit(CombinatorialUnit):
    """
    A superclass for supporting the implementations of combinatorial
    units that make use of Perfectly-Balanced Trees (PBTrees).

    PBTrees are B-Trees, so the number of child nodes for every node
    on the same level are the same. The node counts thus can be 
    figured out algorithmically for each and every node. The content,
    or more accurately, content referenced by the nodes is predictably
    repeated across the tree.
    
    Required Arguements
    -------------------
    * seq - a sequence to be set as the data source from which to derive
      combinatorial terms. If seq supports a reverse-lookup method
      named index(), the CU becomes capable of finding out the index
      from raw combinatorial results.
      
      - The simplest examples are strings, but any sequence, including
        database connections may be used.

      - Other CU's may be used as a source as well. CUs support reverse 
        index lookup using index() only if the CU's source sequence also
        fully supports index().

    * r - an integer determining the number of elements in the combinatoral
      terms output by the CU, in other words the number of items to be
      selected from seq. Accepts int, where r >= 0. Additional constraints
      on the value of r may apply depending on the Combinatorial Unit in
      use.

    * path_src - the path source, or any object which is able to derive
      paths to navigate the combinatorial tree of the CU. The path is a
      representation of a possible output of the CU.
      
      - The PBTree Combinatorial Unit assumes that a CustomBaseNumber
        is used to derive paths. However, any other object of a class
        that implements CustomBaseNumber methods may also work.

      - For more information on how to use a CustomBaseNumber, please
        see the CustomBaseNumberF and CustomBaseNumberP classes above.

    How It Works
    ------------

    Properties of the PBTree
    ========================
    The following properties apply to the PBTree:

    1. As a virtual tree, the actual tree is not present in memory,
       but its nodes are lazily evaluated as they are requested.

    2. The number of nodes per level is a multiple of the number of
       nodes on the previous level.

    3. Every node on the same level share the same exact number of
       sibling nodes.

    4. Any node is allowed to have an arbitrary number of child nodes,
       as long as traits 1 and 2 above apply.

    5. The path to a node can be determined from its index expressed
       as a numerical quantity, by a series of simple arithmetic
       operations.


    Using the PBTree to Represent Combinatorial Terms
    =================================================
    Here's a rather crude diagram of a three-level PBTree, with its
    nodes integer-indexed:

    ::

      10 11 12 13 14 15  16 17 18 19 20 21
        \_|   \_|  \_|   |_/   |_/   |_/
           \    |    |   |     |    /
            4   5    6   7     8   9  
             \__|    \___/    /___/
                 \     |     /
                  1    2    3
                   \___|___/
                       | 
                       0


    NOTE: The tree in this example is drawn from the bottom. For those
    who prefer their trees with the root on top, just imagine it
    upside-down.

    In this example, each node is numbered breadth first: from 'left
    to right, then bottom to top'.

    Paths
    =====
    The path to each node can be used to represent a combinatorial
    result, and the contents of each node could represent the elements
    of the combinatorial term. The exact content of the nodes depends
    on the subclass of PBTreeCombinatorics. Node zero is omitted from
    the path, as its purpose is simply to unify the tree's nodes in
    visualisations.

    The Paths to each of the nodes are as follows:

    Node    Path
    ----    -----------
    0       N/A
    1       (0,)
    2       (1,)
    3       (2,)
    4       (0, 0)
    5       (0, 1)
    6       (1, 0)
    7       (1, 1)
    8       (2, 0)
    9       (2, 1)
    10      (0, 0, 0)
    11      (0, 0, 1)
    12      (0, 1, 0)
    13      (0, 1, 1)
    14      (1, 0, 0)
    15      (1, 0, 1)
    16      (1, 1, 0)
    17      (1, 1, 1)
    18      (2, 0, 0)
    19      (2, 0, 1)
    20      (2, 1, 0)
    21      (2, 1, 1)

    The path can be regarded as a custom-base number with a non-uniform
    radix. The radix of the n'th digit is determined by the number of
    nodes on the n'th level.

    Selecting Terms By Length (r-value)
    ===================================
    The path to each node on a particluar level represents combinatorial
    terms of the same length. A combinatorial unit can be set up for
    returning terms of a set length by constraining the CU to selecting
    nodes of a particular level.
    
    For example, a CU with a source of ten items has a ten-level
    combinatorial tree. Limiting the path to a length of three restricts
    access to the first three levels of the tree, creating a CU that
    selects only three items out of a source of ten.

    Setting the r-value to zero causes the combinatorial unit to return
    empty terms.

    * r - The length of the terms derived from the combinatorial

    Note
    ----
    * While it is possible to make the CatCombination class work
      like the Permutation class, position-dependent combinations
      are the intended use of this class.

    Example
    -------
    Let's re-create the three-word CatCombination from the exampes
    module (from slowcomb.tests.examples.cc). Here's a table of the
    words in the CU:

    Word 1  Word 2  Word 3
    ======  ======  ========
    I       need    sugar
            want    spice 
                    scissors

    This can be done the more beginner-friendly way:

    >>> from slowcomb.slowcomb import CatCombination
    >>> s_a = ('I',)
    >>> s_b = ('need','want')
    >>> s_c = ('sugar','spice','scissors') 
    >>> seqs = (s_a, s_b, s_c)
    >>> catcomb = CatCombination(seqs, r=3)

    Or the hardcore way:

    >>> catcomb = CatCombination ( (('I',), ('need', 'want'),
    ... ('sugar', 'spice', 'scissors')), r=3)

    This combinatorial unit is set up to output only full sentences,
    as it's r-value is set to 3.

    To access all full sentences, use the CU as an iterator:

    >>> for d in catcomb:
    ...     print(d)
    ('I', 'need', 'sugar')
    ('I', 'need', 'spice')
    ('I', 'need', 'scissors')
    ('I', 'want', 'sugar')
    ('I', 'want', 'spice')
    ('I', 'want', 'scissors')

    Reducing the r-value to less than three cuts the sentences
    short to r number of words:

    >>> catcomb = CatCombination(seqs, r=2)
    >>> for d in catcomb:
    ...     print(d)
    ('I', 'need')
    ('I', 'want')

    >>> catcomb = CatCombination ( (('I',), ('need', 'want'), \
    ... ('sugar', 'spice', 'scissors')))

    The resulting combinatorial tree can be visualised as:

        Term Construction Process for the CatCombination CU
        ---------------------------------------------------
        This CU uses the virtual tree in the PBTreeCombinatorics class
        to build its terms. Terms are represented by paths to nodes on
        the tree, and the path to each node is created using 
        PBTreeCombinatronics._get_comb_tree_path(). Each element on the
        tree path is regarded a direct index of an element of a 
        corresponding sub-sequence of _seq_src.

        The i'th element of the path references an item on the i'th
        sequence.

        Example
        =======
        Referring to our example combinatorial unit:

        >>> from slowcomb.slowcomb import CatCombination
        >>> catcomb = CatCombination ( (('I',), ('need', 'want'),
        ... ('sugar', 'spice', 'scissors')), r=3)

        And its tree:

        ::
                        
          su.  sp.  sc.              su.  sp.  sc.
            \___|___/                  \___|___/

                 need                  want
                   \                    /
                    \__________________/

        Let's recall term 4 from the CU:

        >>> catcomb[3]

        As 'I' is element 0 in sequence one, 'want' is element 1

        The tree path would have been (0, 0, 1, 0)

    A sequence of every possible re-arrangement of a source sequence,

    This combinatorial unit may be regarded as a subscriptable
    analogue to Python's built-in itertools.permutations class.

    Arguments
    ---------
    * seq - sequence source to derive permutations from.

    Optional Arguments
    ------------------
    * r - The length of the terms derived from the combinatorial
      unit. Setting r smaller than the number of elements in seq
      in causes the combinatorial unit to return so-called 
      'partial permutations'. Accepts int, 0 â¤ r < len(seqs).

    Examples
    --------
    Here is a classic four-element permuator:

    >>> from slowcomb.slowcomb import Permutation
    >>> words = ('heads','shoulders','knees','toes')
    >>> perm = Permutation(words, r=4)
    >>>     # Easy Mode

    And here is the one-liner equivalent:

    >>> perm = Permutation(('heads','shoulders','knees','toes'),r=4)
    >>>     # Hardcore Mode

    The twenty-four rearrangements can be listed by accessing the CU
    as an iterator:

    >>> for d in perm:
    ...     print(d)
    ('heads', 'shoulders', 'knees', 'toes')
    ('heads', 'shoulders', 'toes', 'knees')
    ('heads', 'knees', 'shoulders', 'toes')

    ('heads', 'toes', 'shoulders', 'knees')
    ('heads', 'toes', 'knees', 'shoulders')
    ('shoulders', 'heads', 'knees', 'toes')
    ('shoulders', 'heads', 'toes', 'knees')

    ('knees', 'heads', 'shoulders', 'toes')
    ('knees', 'heads', 'toes', 'shoulders')
    ('knees', 'shoulders', 'heads', 'toes')
    ('knees', 'shoulders', 'toes', 'heads')
    ('knees', 'toes', 'heads', 'shoulders')
    ('knees', 'toes', 'shoulders', 'heads')
    ('toes', 'heads', 'shoulders', 'knees')
    ('toes', 'heads', 'knees', 'shoulders')
    ('toes', 'shoulders', 'heads', 'knees')
    ('toes', 'shoulders', 'knees', 'heads')
    ('toes', 'knees', 'heads', 'shoulders')
    ('toes', 'knees', 'shoulders', 'heads')

    The permutations may also be individually requested:

    >>> perm[11]
    ('shoulders', 'toes', 'knees', 'heads')

    >>> perm[23]
    ('toes', 'knees', 'shoulders', 'heads')

        legend: h.-heads, s.-shoulders, k.-knees, t.-toes 

        Nodes indices start from zero, and on the left.

    Notice that the last level always has one node per parent, and
    therefore the same number nodes as the second-last level. This is
    due to the element elimination of the permutation process.

    To derive partial permutations, simply set the r-argument to a
    smaller value to the term size of your choice:

    >>> perm = Permutation(('heads', 'shoulders', 'knees', 'toes'), r=2)
    >>> for d in perm:
    ...     print(d)
    ('heads', 'shoulders')
    ('heads', 'knees')
    ('heads', 'toes')
    ('shoulders', 'heads')
    ('shoulders', 'knees')
    ('shoulders', 'toes')
    ('knees', 'heads')
    ('knees', 'shoulders')
    ('knees', 'toes')
    ('toes', 'heads')
    ('toes', 'shoulders')
    ('toes', 'knees')

    Slicing of the permutator is supported too:

    >>> perm[0:12:3]
    (('heads', 'shoulders'), ('shoulders', 'heads'), ('knees', 'heads'), ('toes', 'heads'))

    This is how the partial permutation tree may be visualised:

        Term Construction Process for the Permutation CU
        ------------------------------------------------
        Terms are derived based on the use of a tree path, which decides
        the read order of the source sequence, _seq_src. The path is,
        for the purposes of this method, equivalent to non-uniform
        base number in which:
        
        1. The highest digit has a radix equal to the number of
           elements in _seq_src.

        2. Each successive digit has a radix of the previous minus
           one.

        The root node is not used, and is ignored by the path
        construction algorithm.

        The elements of the tree path is then used as indices to a
        temporary copy of _seq_src. Every item referenced in this
        copy is moved from this temporary copy to a final output
        sequence, out, which it then returned to the caller.


        Example

          Permutation(('heads', 'shoulders', 'knees', 'toes'), r=4)

        We will now derive the seventeenth four-word permutation, marked
        on the diagram above with an asterisk. The path generated herein
        will therefore be (2, 2, 0, 0). The path does not change during
        thie process of constructing the permutation.

        With the address at hand, let's derive the permutation!

        Tree path is (2, 2, 0, 0) throughout the process.
        Temporary seq. 'temp' is ('heads', 'shoulders', 'knees', 'toes')

        Element zero in path: 2
        Curr. temp: ('heads', 'shoulders', 'knees', 'toes')
        Pop temp[2] to end of out
        Current out: ['knees',]

        Element one in path: 2
        Curr. temp: ('heads', 'shoulders', 'toes')
        Pop temp[3] to end of out
        Current out: ['knees', 'toes']

        Pop temp[0] to end of out

        Final out: ['knees', 'toes', 'heads', 'shoulders']

    of elements, while allowing for multiple uses of the same element.
    
    Arguments
    ---------
    * seq - sequence source to derive permutations from.

    * r - The length of the terms derived from the combinatorial
      unit. Accepts int, 0 â¤ r < len(seq).

    There are probably many other names for such a combinatorial
    operation, but this name was chosen as it was observed to pretty
    much identical to allowing permutations to have repeating elements.

    Example
    -------
    A three-element repeats-permitted permutator (RPP) may be created
    like this:

    >>> from slowcomb.slowcomb import PermutationWithRepeats
    >>> permwr = PermutationWithRepeats(('ð', 'ð', 'ð'),r=3)

    Note that r must be set, as without it the permutation will
    have an infinite length and will just keep going on and on...

    Here is every possible output of the RPP:

    >>> for d in permwr:
    ...     print(d)
    ('ð', 'ð', 'ð')
    ('ð', 'ð', 'ð')
    ('ð', 'ð', 'ð')

    ('ð', 'ð', 'ð')
    ('ð', 'ð', 'ð')

    The PermutatorWithRepeats combinatorial unit is capable of terms
    where r (far) exceeds n.

    This creates an effectively 3P9 RPP:

    >>> permwr = PermutationWithRepeats(('ð', 'ð', 'ð'),r=9)

    There are too many permutations to list here, but slices may
    be taken:

    >>> len(permwr)
    19683

    >>> for d in permwr[-16862:-16872:-2]:
    ...     print(d)

    Fun Facts
    ---------
    * You can achieve an identical sequence using a CatCombinator,
      by using multiple copies of the same source sub-sequence.
      However, using this CU may be easier.

    * This permutator was almost called PokiesPermutator, due to the
      similarity to its output to payline readouts on certain types of
      gambling machines.

        Term Construction Process for the PermutationWithRepeats CU
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        The paths of the combinatorial tree of a repeats-permitted
        permutation is, within the scope of this method, identical to
        a base-n. Each digit represents a reference to an element
        of _seq_src, and the n in this case is the number of elements
        in _seq_src.

        In the current implementation, a CustomBaseNumberP object
        configured to behave like a number with uniform base n, where
        n == len(self._seq_src), with length equal to self._r.

        Example
        =======
        Referring to our example permutator:
        
        >>> permwr = PermutationWithRepeats(('ð', 'ð', 'ð'),r=3)

        The combinatorial tree can be visualised as:

        This CU is equivalent to a base-3 number. To create a CU which
        selects only three items, the path will have three elements.
        Therefore, we use a three-digit base-3 number as the path.
        Here are the paths for the first nine terms:

        Term (r=3)  Path       Term
        ==========  =========  ==========

    The combinatorial unit may be created like this:
    
    >>> from slowcomb.slowcomb import Combination
    >>> comb = Combination('ABCDEF',r=6)

    an iterator:

    ...     print(d)
    ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F')
    
    Surprise! There is only one distinct way to select all elements
    from a sequence.

    Let's try something different:

    >>> comb = Combination('ABCDEF',r=4)
    >>> for d in comb:
    ...     print(d)
    ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')
    ('A', 'B', 'C', 'E')

    ('A', 'B', 'D', 'E')
    ('A', 'B', 'D', 'F')
    ('A', 'B', 'E', 'F')
    ('A', 'C', 'D', 'E')
    ('A', 'C', 'D', 'F')
    ('A', 'C', 'E', 'F')
    ('A', 'D', 'E', 'F')
    ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E')

    ('B', 'C', 'E', 'F')
    ('B', 'D', 'E', 'F')
    ('C', 'D', 'E', 'F')

    There are fifteen ways three elements can be selected from six.

        Term Construction Process of the Combination CU
        -----------------------------------------------
        Combinations are derived from a bitmap. Each bit from
        highest to the lowest (left to right) determines which
        corresponding item in the source sequence, _seq_src,
        will be selected.

        A raised (set to 1) leftmost bit on the bitmap selects
        the leftmost item in _seq_src, and each subsequent bit
        selects a corresponding subsequent item.

        This CU uses the Same Number of Bits Sequence (SNOBSequence)
        in order to construct its bitmaps, which are basically
        binary numbers of a fixed length with a fixed number of
        raised bits.

        Example
        -------
        Here's a list of all the possible 4-element selections 
        from the six-element source ('A','B','C','D','E','F'),
        right next to their bitmaps:

    A sequence of all possible selections, of a predefined size,
    from another source sequence, where elements may be repeated
    Multiple arrangements of the same selection are regarded as the
    same selection.

    This class is an subscriptable analogue to the
    Python's built-in itertools.permutations_with_replacement class

    Arguments
    ---------
    * seq - The source sequence to derive combinations from.

    * r - The number of items to select from seq. Accepts int,
      0 â¤ r â¤ len(seq).
        
    Example
    -------
    The combinatorial unit may be created like this:
    
    >>> from slowcomb.slowcomb import CombinationWithRepeats
    >>> combr = CombinationWithRepeats('ABC',r=3)

    To dump every possible term, the CU may be accessed as an
    iterator:

    >>> for d in combr:
    ...     print(d)
    ('A', 'A', 'A')
    ('A', 'A', 'B')
    ('A', 'A', 'C')
    ('A', 'B', 'B')
    ('A', 'B', 'C')
    ('A', 'C', 'C')
    ('B', 'B', 'B')
    ('B', 'B', 'C')
    ('B', 'C', 'C')
    ('C', 'C', 'C')

    Individual terms may be selected:

    >>> combr[6]
    ('B', 'B', 'B')

    Slicing is also supported:

    >>> combr[1:-2:2]
    (('A', 'A', 'B'), ('A', 'B', 'B'), ('A', 'C', 'C'), ('B', 'B', 'C'))

        Term Construction in the CombinationWithRepeats CU
        --------------------------------------------------
        Elements are selected for the terms of the CU based on
        bitmaps. A '1' (raised) bit indicates the presence of an
        item, while a zero (lowered) bit indicates a change to the
        next item in the source sequence, _seq_src.

        The length of the bitmap would be equal to the number of
        selections (r-value), plus the number of items in _seq_src,
        minus one. The number of raised bits is equal to the r-value
        (in _r) of the CU.

        This CU uses the Same Number of Bits Sequence (SNOBSequence)
        in order to construct its bitmaps, which are basically
        binary numbers of a fixed length with a fixed number of
        raised bits.

        This technique was taken from Chapter 1 "The Sample Space",
        of Volume 1 of the 1959 edition of "An Introduction to
        Probability Theory and its Applications" by William Feller.
        Feller describes the use of 'stars' and 'bars' (p12) to
        select and partition items to systematically include and
        exclude them. They are, perhaps counterintuitively,
        represented here by 1's for stars and zeroes for bars.

        Example
        -------
        Here's a list of all the possible 3-element selections 
        from the six-element source ('A','B','C'), right next to
        their bitmaps:

        Bitmap  Term
        ======  ===============
        11100	('A', 'A', 'A')
        11010	('A', 'A', 'B')
        11001	('A', 'A', 'C')
        10110	('A', 'B', 'B')
        10101	('A', 'B', 'C')
        10011	('A', 'C', 'C')
        01110	('B', 'B', 'B')
        01101	('B', 'B', 'C')
        01011	('B', 'C', 'C')
        00111	('C', 'C', 'C')

        The bitmap is 3+3-1 == 5 bits long, and has 3 bits raised.
